# Features Directory

This directory contains feature-specific components and demo configurations.

## Demo Video Maker Configuration

Each feature directory contains a `demo.json` file that defines:
- Interactive elements and selectors
- Cinematic effects and timing
- Demo flow and navigation

## Available Features

- **Dashboard**: Main dashboard with statistics and charts
- **Analytics**: Metrics, charts, and data visualization
- **UserManagement**: User tables and CRUD operations  
- **Settings**: Configuration forms and tabs

## Configuration Files

Each feature uses `demo.json` files instead of auto-generated configurations. See the individual `demo.json` files in each feature directory for specific interactive demonstrations.
