# 🎬 Interactive Demo Planning & Recording Workflow

## Overview

The demo automation tool now includes an interactive planning phase where YOU review and approve each feature demo before recording. This ensures perfect demos every time!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start your demo app
cd demo-app && npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, run the planner
cd ..
node demo-planner.js ./demo-app

# 3. Review each feature and approve/edit the plan
# 4. Execute the approved demos (or run separately)
node demo-executor.js
```

## 📋 The Planning Process

### Step 1: Automatic Analysis
The planner will:
- 🔍 Scan your project structure
- 📁 Identify features (pages, components, modules)
- 🎯 Find interactive elements on each page
- 📝 Create a suggested interaction flow

### Step 2: Interactive Review
For EACH feature found, you'll see:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 Feature: DASHBOARD
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Description: Demo for Dashboard feature

Planned interactions:
1. Navigate to Dashboard
   → Selector: [data-testid="nav-dashboard"]
2. Click "Refresh Data"
   → Selector: [data-testid="refresh-dashboard"]
3. Fill in time range
   → Value: "Last 30 days"
   → Selector: [data-testid="time-range"]

✅ Approve this plan? (y/n/edit):
```

### Step 3: Your Options
- **y/yes** - Approve the plan as-is
- **n/no** - Skip this feature
- **edit** - Modify the plan:
  - Add new steps
  - Delete steps
  - Edit existing steps
  - Reorder interactions

### Step 4: Execution
Once all plans are approved:
- Plans are saved to `demo-plan-approved.json`
- Executor creates cinematic demos with:
  - 🌟 Glowing mouse cursor
  - 🔍 Dynamic zoom effects
  - 🎯 Smooth camera movements
  - 💫 Professional animations

```

## 🎯 Supported Actions

1. **navigate** - Click navigation links
2. **click** - Click buttons, links, etc.
3. **type** - Fill in text fields
4. **select** - Choose dropdown options
5. **wait** - Pause for specified duration

## 💾 Saved Plans

Plans are saved to `demo-plan-approved.json` and can be:
- Re-executed anytime with `node demo-executor.js`
- Manually edited in the JSON file
- Version controlled for consistency

## 🎥 Final Output

Each feature gets its own video:
- `Dashboard-demo.webm`
- `Analytics-demo.webm`
- `UserManagement-demo.webm`
- etc.

All videos include professional cinematic effects!

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be Specific** - Add descriptive text for each interaction
2. **Test First** - Make sure your app is in a good demo state
3. **Think Like a User** - Plan realistic user journeys
4. **Keep It Short** - 5-10 interactions per feature is ideal
5. **Reuse Plans** - Save approved plans for future demos

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

```bash
# Analyze a different project
node demo-planner.js /path/to/project

# Execute specific features only
# (Edit demo-plan-approved.json to include only desired features)
node demo-executor.js

# Create multiple plan versions
cp demo-plan-approved.json demo-plan-investor.json
cp demo-plan-approved.json demo-plan-detailed.json
```

Happy demo creating! 🎬✨
